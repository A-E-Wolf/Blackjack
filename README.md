# Blackjack
This program will play the game of blackjack with the user.
The user will be dealt a hand of two cards, and they may choose to
request another card (hit) or end their turn with their current card value
total (stand), with the objective to get a higher card total than the
dealer while not exceeding a total of 21. The dealer will show one
card during the player’s turn and hide a second. After the player has
finished their turn, the dealer will reveal their hidden card and, if their
card value total is under 17, will automatically draw cards until their
value is greater than or equal to 17. The program will inform the player
whether they have won or lost based on their total, the dealer’s total,
and the rules of the game, at the end of each game. The user can play
as many times as they would like, and when the user is finished playing
games, the program will report how many games were played, how
many games were won, and the average card value total of the games
won, rounded to one decimal place.
